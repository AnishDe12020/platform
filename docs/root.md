description: Build Command Bar commands for yourself, or to share with others.

# Ahoy, world!

Welcome to the [Slapdash](https://slapdash.com) platform. To start, we're opening up a way to extend the functionality of the Slapdash Command Bar, letting you write your own commands.

You can start by learning [how the Command Bar works](command-bar-101/how-it-works.md), pause to flip through the [core terminology](command-bar-101/core-terminology.md) and then have yourself a good sleep to make sure you retain what you read.

Otherwise, we fully encourage you to throw caution to the wind and just [start building your first command](command-bar-101/setup-your-first-command.md). Don't think, just recklessly copy-paste these examples to your editor and see what comes out on the other side.
